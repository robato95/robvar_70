        <h2>Career Projects</h2>
        <div class="project">
            <p><strong>Ladder Plans: </strong>
                Built with the goal of anticipating retailer needs or potential risk using sales projections and considering shipping timelines.
            </p>
            <p><strong>PowerBI Dashboards: </strong>
                I developed Power BI dashboards for the US and growth teams, focusing on visualizing POS data through user-friendly and accessible designs.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Enhanced Data Sources Through Efficient ETL Automation: </strong>
                Chased and sourced new retailer POS data, implementing an efficient ETL process using Python that minimized additional time and effort on my part.

            <h3>Using R for Analytics</h3>
            <p><strong>Prisoner's Dilemma Study and Simulation</strong>: The volunteer's dilemma is a game theory scenario that models a situation where players must decide whether to make a costly sacrifice for the benefit of the group or to wait and benefit from someone else's sacrifice.</p>

        <h2>Other Projects</h2>
        <div class="project">
            <p><strong>Top Toys Webscraper: </strong>P Created a script that scrapes the top 50 toys from Target's and Amazon's top toy site using Selenium and BeautifulSoup.</p>
            <a href="link-to-project-1" target="_blank">View Project</a>
            <p><strong>Investigating Runner's Data: </strong>P The study investigates the relationship between a runner's weight and their mile time, 
                finding a strong positive correlation (86%) and an R-squared value of 74%, indicating that heavier runners tend to have longer mile times, though other factors like height, age, and gender may also influence results.</p>
            <a href="https://rpubs.com/Robato_95/871449" target="_blank">View Project</a>
            <p><strong>Exploring The Distribution of Heights: </strong>P This study examines whether the heights of fathers and sons are normally distributed, finding that both individual heights and 
                the differences in heights closely resemble a normal distribution, supported by histogram and Q-Q plot analyses, although a strong linear correlation between fathers' and sons' heights is not present.</p>

            <p><strong>Understanding Housing in the 1990's: </strong>P The analysis of 1990s California housing data reveals a right-skewed distribution of housing prices, 
                identifies key factors influencing median house values—such as location, housing age, and income—and utilizes a linear regression model to predict prices, achieving a moderate R-squared value of approximately 0.645, indicating reasonable but not perfect explanatory power.</p>
