            <p><strong>Ladder Plans: </strong>
                Built with the goal of anticipating retailer needs or potential risk using sales projections and considering shipping timelines.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Top Toys Webscraper: </strong> Created a script that scrapes the top 50 toys from Target's and Amazon's top toy site using Selenium and BeautifulSoup.</p>

            <p><strong>PowerBI Dashboards: </strong>
                I developed Power BI dashboards for the US and growth teams, focusing on visualizing POS data through user-friendly and accessible designs.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Enhanced Data Sources Through Efficient ETL Automation: </strong>
                Chased and sourced new retailer POS data, implementing an efficient ETL process using Python that minimized additional time and effort on my part.
