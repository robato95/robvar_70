            <h3>Using R for Analytics</h3>
            <p><strong>Predicting Loan Repayment</strong>: This project analyzes Lending Club loan data from 2017 through 2010 to predict whether a borrower will fully repay their loans using a binomial regression model.</p>

            <h3>Experimental Economics</h3>
            <p><strong>Volunteer's Dilemma</strong>: The volunteer's dilemma is a game theory scenario in which participants must choose between making a costly sacrifice for the benefit of the group or waiting for someone else to make the sacrifice while still benefiting from it. I analyzed the results from my class experiment and compared them to the predictions made by the Nash equilibrium model.</p>

            <h3>Quantative Economics with Python</h3>
            <p><strong>Prisoner's Dilemma Simulation </strong>: A simulation that explores decision making in a scenario where two individuals must choose between cooperation or betrayal.</p>

            <p><strong>Wealth Distribution</strong> : Calculating and comparing the Lorenz Curve and Gini Coefficient across time using sample income data.</p>
            <a href="https://nbviewer.org/github/robato95/robvar_70/blob/master/Lorenz%20Curve%20and%20Gini%20Coeffecient.ipynb" target="_blank">View Project</a>
            <p><strong>Equilibrium Analysis</strong> : Visualizing a demand and supply curve to determine equilibrium pricing and quantitites in the market. </p>

            <p><strong>Other Projects:</strong> : I condensed my homework assighments into one file to showcase my abilities. These projects involved permuation tests, simulations, and modeling related to experiments conducted
                by Gode & Sunder (1993) and Schelling (1969).
